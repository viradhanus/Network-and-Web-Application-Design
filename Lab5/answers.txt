    e.  Yes.
        For an example consider a task which is in the OPEN state. Then one client may try to set the state to ASSIGNED while another client may try to set the state to CANCELLED.
        Here the client who updates the state at first will set the state properly but due to this race condition, next immediate client will ended up with illegal transition.
